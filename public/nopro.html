        This portfolio is still a work in progress and not yet finalized. Iâ€™m currently experimenting with different ideas and testing various features, which is why there are several sections and flashy elements that might seem out of place. I spent the entire day working on this, so cut me a slack and ignore this page. Theres no way im styling this one at midnight.
